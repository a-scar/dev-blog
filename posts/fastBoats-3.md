fast boat, slow shore
they said you gotta be sure

concrete, quick pour
I'm not sure if I know me anymore

and one day it becomes true
you think you got em then they're loose
talk enough
but not too much
I think I'm ok, you're ok

fast boat, slow shore
they said you gotta be sure

concrete, quick pour
I'm not sure if I know me anymore

sticky fingers have no fears
whip it up, and it serves for years
slow down
let's hope it's enough
I think I'm ok, you're ok
